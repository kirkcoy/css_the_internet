Duplicate the page below. Watch how many times div tags are used. Whenever there is one element within a division, it does not need that division. 

- It's recommended that the CSS attributes are reset and normalize before adding your own CSS attributes.
- Make sure the HTML is validated and that float: left or right is not being used.
- Make sure to double check the code for any redundant use of ids or classes.
- Make sure there is no any single element within a division. 
- Refactor the HTML code, if necessary.
